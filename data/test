There is justification for killing babies if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us , and in such a situation they may be harmed deliberately , and not only during combat with adults . ‚Äù‚Ä ¶ In a chapter entitled ‚ÄúDeliberate harm to innocents , ‚Äù the book explains that war is directled mainly against the pursuers , but those who belong to the enemy nation are also considered the enemy because they are assisting murderers . A full translation of the Maariv article can be read after the jump . < big > < big > < big > < big > < big > The complete guide to killing non-Jews Roi Sharon , Maariv , November 9 2009 [ page 2 with front page teaser ] When is it permissible to kill non-Jews ? The book Torat ha-Melekh [ The King‚Ä ô s Teaching ] , which was just published , was written by Rabbi Yitzhak Shapira , the dean of the Od Yosef Hai yeshiva in the community of Yitzhar near Nablus , together with another rabbi from the yeshiva , Yossi Elitzur . The book contains no fewer than 230 pages on the laws concerning the killing of non-Jews , a kind of guide for anyone who ponders the question of if and when it is permissible to take the life of a non-Jew . Although the book is not being distributed by the leading book companies , it has already received warm recommendations from right-wing elements , including recommendations from important rabbis such as Yitzhak Ginsburg , Dov Lior and Yaakov Yosef , that were printed at the beginning of the book . The book is being distributed via the Internet and through the yeshiva , and at this stage the introductory price is NIS 30 per copy . At the memorial ceremony that was held over the weekend in Jerusalem for Rabbi Meir Kahane , who was killed nineteen years ago , copies of the book were sold . Throughout the book , the authors deal with in-depth theoretical questions in Jewish religious law regarding the killing of non-Jews . The words ‚ÄúArabs‚Äù and ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù are not mentioned even indirectly , and the authors are careful to avoid making explicit statements in favor of an individual taking the law into his own hands . The book includes hundreds of sources from the Bible and religious law . The book includes quotes from Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook , one of the fathers of religious Zionism , and from Rabbi Shaul Yisraeli , one of the deans of the Mercaz Harav Yeshiva , the stronghold of national-religious Zionism that is located in Jerusalem . The book opens with a prohibition against killing non-Jews and justifies it , among other things , on the grounds of preventing hostility and any desecration of God‚Ä ô s name . But very quickly , the authors move from prohibition to permission , to the various dispensations for harming non-Jews , with the central reason being their obligation to uphold the seven Noahide laws , which every human being on earth must follow . Among these commandments are prohibitions on theft , bloodshed and idolatry . [ The seven Noahide laws prohibit idolatry , murder , theft , illicit sexual relations , blasphemy and eating the flesh of a live animal , and require societies to institute just laws and law courts ] ‚ÄúWhen we approach a non-Jew who has violated the seven Noahide laws and kill him out of concern for upholding these seven laws , no prohibition has been violated , ‚Äù states the book , which emphasizes that killing is forbidden unless it is done in obedience to a court ruling . But later on , the authors limit the prohibition , noting that it applies only to a ‚Äúproper system that deals with non-Jews who violate the seven Noahide commandments . ‚Äù The book includes another conclusion that explains when a non-Jew may be killed even if he is not an enemy of the Jews . ‚ÄúIn any situation in which a non-Jew‚Ä ô s presence endangers Jewish lives , the non-Jew may be killed even if he is a righteous Gentile and not at all guilty for the situation that has been created , ‚Äù the authors state . ‚ÄúWhen a non-Jew assists a murderer of Jews and causes the death of one , he may be killed , and in any case where a non-Jew‚Ä ô s presence causes danger to Jews , the non-Jew may be killed . ‚Äù One of the dispensations for killing non-Jews , according to religious law , applies in a case of din rodef [ the law of the ‚Äúpursuer , ‚Äù according to which one who is pursuing another with murderous intent may be killed extrajudicially ] even when the pursuer is a civilian . ‚ÄúThe dispensation applies even when the pursuer is not threatening to kill directly , but only indirectly , ‚Äù the book states . ‚ÄúEven a civilian who assists combat fighters is considered a pursuer and may be killed . Anyone who assists the army of the wicked in any way is strengthening murderers and is considered a pursuer . A civilian who encourages the war gives the king and his soldiers the strength to continue . Therefore , any citizen of the state that opposes us who encourages the combat soldiers or expresses satisfaction over their actions is considered a pursuer and may be killed . Also , anyone who weakens our own state by word or similar action is considered a pursuer . ‚Äù Rabbis Shapira and Elitzur determine that children may also be harmed because they are ‚Äúhindrances . ‚Äù The rabbis write as follows : ‚ÄúHindrances‚Ä " babies are found many times in this situation . They block the way to rescue by their presence and do so completely by force . Nevertheless , they may be killed because their presence aids murder . There is justification for killing babies if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us , and in such a situation they may be harmed deliberately , and not only during combat with adults . ‚Äù In addition , the children of the leader may be harmed in order to apply pressure to him . If attacking the children of a wicked ruler will influence him not to behave wickedly , they may be harmed . ‚ÄúIt is better to kill the pursuers than to kill others , ‚Äù the authors state . In a chapter entitled ‚ÄúDeliberate harm to innocents , ‚Äù the book explains that war is directly mainly against the pursuers , but those who belong to the enemy nation are also considered the enemy because they are assisting murderers . Retaliation also has a place and purpose in this book by Rabbis Shapira and Elitzur . ‚ÄúIn order to defeat the enemy , we must behave toward them in a spirit of retaliation and measure for measure , ‚Äù they state . ‚ÄúRetaliation is absolutely necessary in order to render such wickedness not worthwhile . Therefore , sometimes we do cruel deeds in order to create the proper balance of terror . ‚Äù In one of the footnotes , the two rabbis write in such a way that appears to permit individuals to act on their own , outside of any decision by the government or the army . ‚ÄúA decision by the nation is not necessary to permit shedding the blood of the evil kingdom , ‚Äù the rabbis write . ‚ÄúEven individuals from the nation being attacked may harm them . ‚Äù Unlike books of religious law that are published by yeshivas , this time the rabbis added a chapter containing the book‚Ä ô s conclusions . Each of the six chapters is summarized into main points of several lines , which state , among other things : ‚ÄúIn religious law , we have found that non-Jews are generally suspected of shedding Jewish blood , and in war , this suspicion becomes a great deal stronger . One must consider killing even babies , who have not violated the seven Noahide laws , because of the future danger that will be caused if they are allowed to grow up to be as wicked as their parents . ‚Äù Even though the authors are careful , as stated , to use the term ‚Äúnon-Jews , ‚Äù there are certainly those who could interpret the nationality of the ‚Äúnon-Jews‚Äù who are liable to endanger the Jewish people . This is strengthened by the leaflet ‚ÄúThe Jewish Voice , ‚Äù which is published on the Internet from Yitzhar , which comments on the book : ‚ÄúIt is superfluous to note that nowhere in the book is it written that the statements are directly only to the ancient non-Jews . ‚Äù The leaflet‚Ä ô s editors did not omit a stinging remark directed at the GSS , who will certainly take the trouble to get themselves a copy . ‚ÄúThe editors suggest to the GSS that they award the prize for Israel‚Ä ô s security to the authors , ‚Äù the leaflet states , ‚Äúwho gave the detectives the option of reading the summarized conclusions without any need for in-depth study of the entire book . ‚Äù One student of the Od Yosef Hai yeshiva in Yitzhar explained , from his point of view , where Rabbis Shapira and Elitzur got the courage to speak so freely on a subject such as the killing of non-Jews . ‚ÄúThe rabbis aren‚Ä ô t afraid of prosecution because in that case , Maimonides [ Rabbi Moses ben Maimon , 1135‚Ä " 1204 ] and Nahmanides [ Rabbi Moses ben Nahman , 1194‚Ä " 1270 ] would have to stand trial too , and anyway , this is research on religious law , ‚Äù the yeshiva student said . ‚ÄúIn a Jewish state , nobody sits in jail for studying Torah . ‚Äù

D	Abandoned by the mining industry in 2001 , the 10,000 residents of Bulembu soon deserted the town in search for employment . At the same time , the country was , and continues to be , ravaged by the highest [ [ HIV / AIDS ] ] infection rate in the world ( 38 . 8% ) and the resulting orphan crisis . In 2006 , a team of entrepreneurs and social developers saw the potential in Bulembu and purchased the 1,700-hectare property with a clear vision ; to restore Bulembu to a vibrant , self-sustaining community by the year 2020 . This vision for sustainability includes fostering the development of a new generation of emerging leaders through orphan care , education , health services and commerce . Restore a town . Transform a nation . Visit Bulembu‚Ä ô s website : www . bulembu.org 
I	Background 
D	Bulembu Enterprise 
D	Bulembu believes that the creation of sustainable enterprises can be the solution to Swaziland‚Ä ô s chronic poverty and even the country‚Ä ô s AIDS pandemic . With the right sustainability models and entrepreneurial leadership , Bulembu enterprises will generate $6 million in profits annually and thereby ensure Bulembu becomes an economically self-sustaining community . ' ' ' Bulembu Country Lodge ' ' ' Once the home of senior mine staff , the Bulembu Country Lodge offers 12 enchanting and comfortable en-suite bedrooms in the converted mine manager‚Ä ô s home or quaint detached directors‚Ä ô cottages located amongst the terraced gardens . ( Separate village houses can be hired on self-catering or full board basis . ) Bulembu‚Ä ô s Lead Chef serves hearty breakfasts and wholesome country lunches and dinners served from a set menu , which changes daily to take advantage of fresh and local ingredients . Guests may take advantage of the pool , squash court , pool table , lounges , atv rentals and many other amenities . As darkness descends guests often enjoy a braai and drinks on the patio while being entertained by local Swazis from nearby villages as they perform traditional dances . Guests are welcome to take a step back into the past and tour many of Bulembu‚Ä ô s buildings that date back to the 1930‚Ä ô s. - The 285-seat cinema which has been left in its original state . - The old scientific mine testing facilities . - The historic Bulembu cableway is now the longest cableway in the world , outside of Europe . It extends more than 21 km into South Africa . Currently this building is being renovated to house the Bulembu Museum . It is slated to be open in early 2010 . - The town hospital , the old jail and tiny court house . Bulembu sits at the base of Swaziland‚Ä ô s highest mountain , Emlembe ( 1863m ) . Guests are invited to hike the mountain , cool off in waterfalls and rock pools , or to go bird watching . Accommodation rates are available upon request . Email ' ' lodge@bulembu . org ' ' . ' ' ' Bulembu Timber ' ' ' Bulembu Timber was launched in the spring of 2006 as the community‚Ä ô s first macro-enterprise . Pressing through a difficult first year of operations , Bulembu Timber has emerged as a stable , profit generating business and has become a part of the core foundation to the community‚Ä ô s quest for sustainability . Bulembu Timber was operated by Neil Rijkenberg , the largest private timber exporter in Swaziland , until September 2008 when the position of Timber Manager was handed over to Kurt Puttkammer . The property contains over 960 hectares of young and mature Eucalyptus trees ( Paniculata , Cloesiana , Saligna and Pinus species ) , which have a regeneration time of 6-16 years . Due to the low-cost access to neighboring forests the majority of Bulembu‚Ä ô s timber comes from neighboring forests ‚Ä " Bulembu Timber only does clean up harvesting to reestablish local forests . Bulembu Timber produces planks but also uses 500 tons of timber each month to produce 100 tons of charcoal . This enterprise employs over 180 residents from the Bulembu community and its capital assets include a production sawmill and two long-haul trucks , which export 30-40 loads ( 2,000 tons / 700m3 of planks ) of timber each month . Bulembu Timber has obtained certification by the Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) , which increases market access and ensures Bulembu‚Ä ô s commitment to environmental stewardship standards . Future plans for Bulembu Timber include utilizing 4,000 tons of timber per month while increasing the efficiency , profit and sustainability of the business and planting seedlings from the nursery in the forest . ' ' ' Bulembu Water ' ' ' In 2008 Bulembu Water obtained Emafini , a water cooler rental and bottling plant just outside of [ [ Mbabane ] ] . At the end of 2008 the Emafini brand was officially changed to Bulembu Water and the operation was moved from Emafini to Bulembu in early 2009 . The enterprise has sunk a borehole in Bulembu and is now bottling some of the purest Natural Spring Water to be found in Swaziland . Bulembu Water‚Ä ô s twelve employees currently serve 128 water cooler rental customers who rent 176 coolers on a monthly lease . A brand new 500 ml water bottling plant was just completed in November 2009 and soon customers will be able to purchase Bulembu Water in 500ml bottles . Future plans for Bulembu Water include the introduction of sparkling and flavored water . ' ' ' Bulembu Honey ' ' ' Bulembu Honey was established in 2007 with a large part of the start-up capital provided by the Golder Trust for Orphans . By 2008 the number of hives had increased from the original 150 to 800 and the honey produced from these hives weighed in at just more than 7 tons . Currently the business consists of just over 1,000 hives that have produced more than 12 tons of honey during the 2009 honey season . As the honey is of excellent quality and it sells quickly - there is only a ton in stock left of the 2009 harvest . Bulembu Honey employs six people and aside from producing honey , the company also manufactures its own hives . The hives are used onsite and are also sold to other beekeepers in Swaziland . Bulembu Honey is currently the largest bee keeping and honey producing concern in Swaziland . With its success this enterprise is able to contribute E20 , 000 per month towards the Bulembu Orphan Care program . Plans for the future include establishing a second bee-keeping unit that will take care of another 1,000 hives by 2010 . ' ' ' Bulembu Dairy ' ' ' During the time of the [ [ Havelock Mine ] ] 15 hectares of fields at the East end of town were home to the Havelock Mine Golf Club . These days the fairways have been plowed and replanted , the trees have been cut down , and the clubhouse gutted and renovated ‚Ä " all of it now home to Bulembu Dairy . Renovations on the old Club House began in March 2009 and by the end of August , 25 cows had taken to pasture . The Dairy is run by Dairy Manager Colin Lovely and employs ten people . The cows are milked twice a day at 6 : 00 am and 3 : 00 pm , seven days per week , and produce approximately 330 liters of milk each day . The milk goes directly into bulk cooling tanks where it is cooled to 4 degrees Celsius and then processed into emasi ( sour milk that is popular in Swaziland ) or as fresh milk . Since the herd is TB and Brucellosis free and the dairy runs a hygienic process the milk is currently left unpasteurized . The milk is being sold for 7R / liter in Bulembu and is also sold in Piggs Peak ( 10 km away ) for a similar price . Any excess milk is sold to Parmalat , a dairy processing company in Swaziland . Plans for the future include having 45 cows at pasture by the middle of 2010 and close to 200 cows in 2020 to coincide with the 2,000 orphans that will then be living in Bulembu . ' ' ' Bulembu Bakery ' ' ' In early 2009 the Golder Trust for Orphans donated funds towards the purchasing of bakery equipment for Bulembu . On October 19 , 2009 the Bulembu Bakery opened its doors . The Bakery‚Ä ô s four employees work to produce bread for the orphan homes as well as a wide selection of rye bread , doughnuts , chelsea buns and rolls for Bulembu Ministries Swaziland as well as Bulembu townspeople . = = Bulembu Orphan Care = = Bulembu has an ambitious goal to support the ongoing care of 2,000 orphaned and vulnerable children by 2020 . By November 2009 there were 108 orphans under Bulembu Ministry Swaziland‚Ä ô s care . Bulembu‚Ä ô s commitment is to provide holistic care for each child in a home , rather than in a large institutional orphanage . Each child lives in a refurbished home with a caregiver and 5 other children . In this way , each child becomes a part of a caring family that will prepare them for a bright future filled with hope and to emerge as the leaders of tomorrow . These new families will be the thread that restores the social fabric of a nation on the verge of collapse due to the [ [ AIDS ] ] pandemic . Orphan Care sponsorships help rescue children , raise leaders and rebuild a community and a nation . 100% of the Total Orphan Care sponsorships go directly to the child , providing coverage for monthly medical ( $10 ) , food ( $30 ) , caregiver ( $30 ) , clothing and housing ( $45 ) and education ( $60 ) . Visit the Bulembu website www . bulembu.org to become a Total Orphan Care and Education ( TOCE ) sponsor . = = Bulembu International = = Bulembu International ( BI ) is comprised of multiple complimentary organizations : Bulembu Foundation , NOW Africa , Bulembu UK , Bulembu USA ( Partners in Action ) and Bulembu Ministries Swaziland .

I	In late 2009 Longtime signee Beanie Sigel reported his departure from Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam due to his controversy with former boss Jay-Z . 
I	all occurred on October 30 , 2009 , when Beanie Sigel abruptly released a track called " What You Talkin ' Bout ; " using the beat to Jay-Z's ' ' [ [ The Blueprint 3 ] ] ' ' intro , Sigel appeared bitter and frustrated with his former mentor on the song , making several claims about the way he was treated by both Jay-Z and Dame Dash while he was signed to Roc-A-Fella . Clarifying his stance in an interview given to Philadelphia radio station The Beat , Sigel alleged that Jay-Z and Dash split over financial issues , pointing out several subliminal Jay-Z lines that were meant for his former partner ; he also claimed that Jay-Z blocked his sales by never appearing on the rapper's singles , and putting out his own singles and albums at the same times Sigel would try to promote his own records , placing them in competition for record sales , as well as refusing to let him leave Roc-A-Fella to sign with [ [ 50 Cent ] ] 's ' ' ' [ [ G-Unit Records ] ] ' ' ' .

I	CooperCell phones or cellular phones are so called as they cover compartmentalized , cell like areas . The origin of the Cell phone can be traced back to the year 1973 when Motorola came up with World ` s first cellular portable telephone which was commercialised as Motorola DynaTAC 8000X . These days , new cell phones are being added at a rapid pace . The parts of them typically consist of following : circuit board ; antenna ; keyboard ; LCD - liquid crystal display ; battery ; microphone ; speaker . In recent times , they are available with a wide range of functions . To list a few functions , depending on the type of cell phone you choose : store contact information ; keep track of appointments ; set reminders ; prepare to-do lists ; send / receive e-mail ; play games ; send text messages ( sms ) ; access to internet ; watch and enjoy TV ; built-in calculator ; integration with other devices like GPS receivers , MP3 players , etc. Cell phones , operating on radio frequency , have come up with an innovative cellular approach to counter limited availability of RF spectrum . Now , several cell phone towers are used to cater to a large geographic area . Each tower ( base station ) , covers a circular area called a cell . A large region is split into a number of cells allowing different base stations to use the same channels / frequencies for communication . This enables thousands and thousands of mobile telephone users to share far fewer channels .

It also features the second-lowest point in the [ [ Western Hemisphere ] ] and the lowest point in North America at [ [ Badwater Basin | Badwater ] ] , which is { { convert | 282 | ft | m } } below sea level . It is home to many species of plants and animals that have adapted to this harsh [ [ desert ] ] environment . Some examples include [ [ Larrea tridentata | creosote bush ] ] , [ [ Bighorn Sheep ] ] , [ [ Coyote ] ] , and the [ [ Death Valley Pupfish ] ] , a survivor of much wetter times . Approximately 95% of the park is designated as [ [ U.S. Wilderness Area | wilderness ] ] . < ref > [ [ #NPSwebsite | NPS website ] ] , " Backcountry Roads " < / ref > Its wilderness area , { { convert | 4774 | mi2 } } , is the largest in the Lower 48 states , and the sixth largest in the United States overall . Death Valley National Park is visited annually by more than 770,000 visitors who come to enjoy its diverse geologic features , desert wildlife , historic sites , scenery , clear night skies and the solitude of the extreme desert environment . < ref name = " NPSguide " / > [ [ Mining ] ] was the primary activity in the area before it was protected . The first known non - [ [ Native Americans in the United States | Native American ] ] s to enter Death Valley did so in the winter of 1849 , thinking they would save time by taking a shortcut to the [ [ California Gold Rush | gold fields of California ] ] . They were stuck for weeks and in the process gave the valley its name , even though only one of their group died there . Several short-lived [ [ boomtown | boom town ] ] s sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to exploit minor local bonanzas of gold . The only long-term profitable [ [ ore ] ] to be mined , however , was [ [ borax ] ] , a mineral used to make soap and an important industrial [ [ compound ( chemistry ) | compound ] ] . Today , borax is an essential component of high-temperature resistant boro-silicate glass products , for example [ [ Pyrex ] ] cookware . [ [ 20-Mule Teams | Twenty-mule teams ] ] were famously used to transport ore out of the valley , helping to make it famous and the subject of books , radio programs , television series , and movies . The natural environment of the area has been shaped largely by its geology . The valley itself is actually a [ [ graben ] ] . The oldest [ [ rock ( geology ) | rock ] ] s are extensively [ [ Metamorphism | metamorphosed ] ] and at least 1 . 7&nbsp ; billion years old . < ref name = " Wright1997p611 " / > Ancient warm , shallow seas deposited marine sediments until [ [ rift ] ] ing opened the [ [ Pacific Ocean ] ] . Additional sedimentation occurred until a [ [ subduction zone ] ] formed off the coast . This uplifted the region out of the sea and created a line of [ [ volcano ] ] es . Later the [ [ Crust ( geology ) | crust ] ] started to pull apart , creating the current [ [ Basin and Range ] ] landform . Valleys filled with sediment and , during the wet times of [ [ ice age ] ] s , with lakes , such as [ [ Lake Manly ] ] . [ [ Image : Death Valley NP master map . png | thumb | 290px | right | upright | Map of the park showing old Monument land ( light green ) and the expanded Park land ( dark green ) ] ] = = Geographic setting = = Within the park there are two major valleys : [ [ Death Valley ] ] and [ [ Panamint Valley ] ] , both of which were formed within the last few million years and both bounded by north‚Ä " south-trending [ [ mountain range ] ] s. < ref name = " Sharp1997p1 " / > These and adjacent valleys follow the general trend of [ [ Basin and Range ] ] topography with one modification : there are parallel [ [ strike-slip fault ] ] s that perpendicularly bound the central extent of Death Valley . The result of this shearing action is additional extension in the central part of Death Valley which causes a slight widening and relatively more subsidence there . [ [ Image : Death Valley,19820817 , Desert , radiator water tank . jpg | thumbnail | left | Desert and abandoned radiator water tank near Grapevine ] ] Uplift of surrounding mountain ranges and subsidence of the valley floor are both occurring . The uplift on the Black Mountains is so fast that the [ [ alluvial fan ] ] s ( fan-shaped deposits at the mouth of canyons ) there are relatively small and steep compared to the huge alluvial fans coming off the [ [ Panamint Range ] ] . In many places so-called " wine glass canyons " are formed along the Black Mountains front as a result . This type of canyon results from the mountain range's relatively fast uplift which does not allow the canyons enough time to cut a classic V-shape all the way down to the stream bed . Instead a V-shape ends at a slot canyon halfway down with a relatively small and steep alluvial fan on which the stream sediments collect . At { { convert | 282 | ft | m } } below [ [ sea level ] ] , < ref name = " Wright1997p611 " / > [ [ Badwater Basin ] ] on Death Valley's floor is the second-lowest point in the Western Hemisphere ( behind [ [ Laguna del Carb√≥n ] ] in [ [ Argentina ] ] ) , while [ [ Mount Whitney ] ] , only { { convert | 85 | mi | km } } to the west , rises to { { convert | 14505 | ft | m } } . < ref name = " Sharp1997p1 " > { { harvnb | Sharp | 1997 | p = 1 } } < / ref > This topographic relief is the greatest elevation gradient in the [ [ Continental United States | contiguous United States ] ] and is the terminus point of the [ [ Great Basin ] ] 's southwestern drainage . < ref name = " Wright1997p611 " / > Although the extreme lack of water in the Great Basin makes this distinction of little current practical use , it does mean that in wetter times the lake that once filled Death Valley ( [ [ Lake Manly ] ] ) was the last stop for water flowing in the region , meaning the water there was relatively saturated in dissolved materials . Thus the [ [ Salt pan ( geology ) | salt pan ] ] s in Death Valley are among the largest in the world and are rich in minerals , such as [ [ borax ] ] and various [ [ salt ] ] s and [ [ hydrate ] ] s. < ref name = " Wright1997p625 " > { { harvnb | Wright and Miller | 1997 | p = 625 } } < / ref > The largest salt pan in the park extends { { convert | 40 | mi | km } } from the Ashford Mill Site to the Salt Creek Hills , covering some { { convert | 200 | sqmi | km2 } } of the valley floor . < ref name = " Wright1997p625 " / > < ref group = note > Badwater , the Devils Golf Course , and Salt Creek are all part of the Death Valley Saltpan . < / ref > The second-best known [ [ playa ] ] in the park is the [ [ Racetrack Playa | Racetrack ] ] , famous for its moving rocks .

Unlike more typical locations across the Mojave Desert , many of the water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity of plant and animal species that are not found anywhere else in the world . < ref name = " FocusWater " / > The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of [ [ evolution ] ] that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the [ [ Pleistocene ] ] epoch . = = Activities = = { { seealso | Places of interest in the Death Valley area } } Sightseeing is available by personal automobile , [ [ four-wheel drive ] ] , bicycle , [ [ mountain bicycle | mountain bike ] ] ( on established roadways only ) , and [ [ hiking ] ] .

There are hiking trails of varying lengths and difficulties , but most backcountry areas are accessible only by cross-country hiking . There are literally thousands of hiking possibilities . The normal season for visiting the park is from October 15 to May 15 because of summer extremes in temperature . A costumed living history tour of the historic Death Valley [ [ Scotty's Castle ] ] is conducted for a fee . [ [ Image : surfing Star Dune .

The [ [ Death Valley Natural History Association ] ] maintains a bookstore specifically geared to the natural and cultural history of the park . Death Valley National Park is a popular location for stargazing as it has one of the darkest night skies in the United States .

I	Boal is known to say that he did not create laws arbitrarily while he was city councilor . Instead , he asked people what they wanted . Other polititians were not very fond of this . Out of 40 of Boal's proposed laws , only 13 got approved during his term as councilor of Rio de Janeiro . Boal also worked with prisoners in Rio and S√£o Paulo . Boal argued that people in prison are not free ni space , but that they are in time , and that the Theater of the Oppressed strives to create different types of freedom so that people are able to imagine and think about the past , the present , and invent the future instead of having to wait for it . All this was in order for prisoners to have " a healthier and more creative lifestyle . " People in the [ [ Movimento sem Terra ] ] or [ [ Landless Workers Movement ] ] of Brazil also experienced working with Boal's theater methods . Boa's son Juli√°n worked along with his father and now continues to take the Theater of the Oppressed to various communities in Brazil and around the world . < ref > http : / / www . panuelosenrebeldia.com.ar / index . php ? option = com_content&task = view&id = 248&Itemid = 253 < / ref >

The group was under tremendous pressure for a hit from their record company [ [ Pye ] ] , after their two previous single releases failed to chart . Ray Davies in particular was stubbornly persistent in forcing the Kinks ' management and record company to take the time and money needed to develop the record's landmark sound and style . Davies ' efforts on behalf of the career-making song effectively established him as the leader and chief songwriter of the Kinks . [ [ Image : The Kinks You Really Got Me riff . PNG | left | thumb | 525px | The Kinks ' " You Really Got Me " guitar riff ] ] The influential distortion sound of the guitar track was created after guitarist [ [ Dave Davies ] ] sliced the speaker cone of his [ [ guitar amplifier ] ] with a razor blade and poked it with a pin . < ref name = " amgreview " / > The amplifier was affectionately called " little green , " after the name of the amplifier made by the [ [ Elpico ] ] company , and purchased in Davies ' neighbourhood music shop , slaved into a [ [ Vox AC-30 ] ] . The [ [ guitar solo ] ] on the recording is the source of one of the most controversial and persistent myths in all of rock and roll : that it was not played by the Kinks ' lead guitarist Dave Davies , but by then-session player [ [ Jimmy Page ] ] . The solo was undoubtedly played by [ [ Dave Davies ] ] ( then seventeen years old ) , as everyone involved in the July 1964 recording sessions for the track has always maintained . Although an effective and integral part of the song , it is essentially a faster variation of the " [ [ Louie Louie ] ] " guitar solo , and did not represent a great technical or stylistic achievement on par with that song's driving three-chord rhythm backing ( save for the method of playing the [ [ pentatonic scale ] ] in a manner that " seems " sloppy ; this technique is a major watershed in the history of rock and roll , arguably an influence on [ [ punk rock ] ] ) . However , the story has circulated for decades that the solo was played by [ [ Jimmy Page ] ] , who later joined [ [ The Yardbirds ] ] and [ [ Led Zeppelin ] ] . Page was in fact hired by Kinks producer [ [ Shel Talmy ] ] as a session [ [ rhythm guitar ] ] ist on a handful of tracks on the Kinks ' first album , but those sessions took place several weeks after the " You Really Got Me " session . Page has always denied playing the song's guitar solo , going so far as to state in a 1977 interview that " I didn't play on ' You Really Got Me ' and that's what pisses him ( [ [ Ray Davies ] ] ) off . " Rock historian and author Doug Hinman makes a case that the rumour was begun and fostered by the established UK [ [ Rhythm and Blues ] ] community , many of whose members were resentful that an upstart band of teenagers such as the Kinks could produce such a powerful and influential blues-based recording , seemingly out of nowhere . Several session musicians did play on " You Really Got Me " : The piano was by either keyboardist [ [ Jon Lord ] ] of [ [ Deep Purple ] ] < ref > [ http : / / www . picturedwithin.com / interviews / leicester_mercury . html Jon Lord Official Fan Site - Pictured Within ] www . picturedwithin.com < / ref > or Arthur Greenslade < ref > [ http : / / www . creemmagazine.com / _site / BeatGoesOn / Kinks / UnravelsTheKinks001 . html Ray Davies Unravels The Kinks ] Interview , Bill Holdship , [ http : / / www . creemmagazine.com CREEM Magazine ] , December 1981. Retrieved [ [ 2009-09-29 ] ] < / ref > In the same interview , Davies says that there was a session guitarist doubling his rhythm part , but that it wasn't Page . At the behest of producer [ [ Shel Talmy ] ] , session drummer [ [ Bobby Graham ] ] played drums on the recording , rather than regular Kinks drummer [ [ Mick Avory ] ] . Graham went on to play the main drum part on many of the Kinks ' early recordings . Interestingly , both Jon Lord and Shel Talmy claim Jimmy Page did play on " You Really Got Me " .

" The Kinks ' use of distorted guitar riffs continued with songs like " [ [ All Day and All of the Night ] ] , " " [ [ Tired of Waiting for You ] ] , " and " [ [ Set Me Free ( The Kinks song ) | Set Me Free ] ] , " among others . [ [ Pete Townshend ] ] of [ [ The Who ] ] has stated that their first single , " [ [ I Can't Explain ] ] , " was an intentional soundalike of The Kinks ' work at the time ( The Who were also produced by [ [ Shel Talmy ] ] at that time ) . The Kinks would go on to perform successfully together as a band for over 30 years , through many musical styles , and they would always play " You Really Got Me " in concert .

She served again from 2001 to 2006 . Zia is the widow of assassinated [ [ President of Bangladesh ] ] [ [ Ziaur Rahman ] ] , and leads his old party , the [ [ Bangladesh Nationalist Party ] ] ( BNP ) . After 35 years of independence of Bangladesh she has ruled the country for about 10 years ( longest period ) . She has been elected to five separate parliamentary constituencies in the general elections of 1991 , 1996 , and 2001 , a feat unachieved by any other politician in Bangladeshi history . In 2006 , [ [ Forbes ] ] ranked Khaleda Zia at number 33 in its list of the [ [ Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women | 100 Most Powerful Women in the world ] ] . < ref > [ http : / / www . forbes.com / lists / 2006 / 11 / 06women_Khaleda-Zia_JSK7 . html " The 100 Most Powerful Women " ] , Forbes , August 26 , 2006. < / ref > = = Early life = = Khaleda Zia was born to Iskandar Majumder and Taiyaba Majumder in [ [ Dinajpur District , Bangladesh | Dinajpur District ] ] on 15 August 1945 . The family originally hails from [ [ Feni District | Feni ] ] , a southeastern district of the country . She studied in Dinajpur Government Girls High School . In 1960 , she married [ [ Ziaur Rahman ] ] . = = First Lady = = Her husband later became Chief of the Armed Forces and subsequently assumed power as Chief Martial Law Administrator following a series of military coups . He attempted to move toward a civilian administration by forming the BNP and becoming democratically elected as President . = = Political career = = Until the assassination of her husband , President [ [ Ziaur Rahman ] ] , in an abortive military coup in [ [ Chittagong ] ] on 30 May 1981 , Khaleda Zia had taken little interest in either politics or public life . Even when her husband assumed power after the political changes in 1975 , she remained a shy and withdrawn housewife spending most of her time raising her two sons . After the assassination of President Ziaur Rahman , Vice-President Justice [ [ Abdus Sattar ] ] took over as the acting President and also as Chairman of the BNP . Army Chief of Staff General [ [ Hossain Mohammad Ershad ] ] overthrew Justice Sattar on March 24 , 1982 . In March 1983 , Justice Sattar appointed Khaleda Zia as vice-chairman of the BNP . In February 1984 , she became the chairperson as Justice Sattar retired from politics . On August 10 , 1984 the party elected her the chairperson . Under the leadership of Begum Zia , the BNP formed a 7-party alliance in 1983 and launched a relentless struggle against the autocratic regime of General Ershad . During the 9-year-long struggle against Ershad , Begum Zia did not compromise with his autocratic and illegitimate government . For her strict adherence to the principles , the government restricted her movements by using prohibitive laws . She was detained seven times in eight years . But undaunted , Begum Zia continued to provide leadership in the movement for ousting Ershad . Like Zia before him , Ershad attempted to give his rule a civilian and democratic face , but Khaleda Zia boycotted all elections during his rule . Khaleda was detained seven times during almost nine years of autocratic rule under President Ershad before his resignation on 6 December 1990 . In the face of a mass upsurge spearheaded by alliances led by Begum Zia and Sheikh Hasina , Ershad at last handed over power to a neutral caretaker government on December 6 , 1990 . In the parliamentary elections held under this government on February 27 , 1991 , Bangladesh Nationalist Party emerged victorious as a single majority party . Begum Zia contested from five constituencies in three consecutive parliamentary elections and won in all seats . This of course , is a unique feat in the history of elections in the country . < ref > [ http : / / search . com.bd / banglapedia / HT / Z_0014 . htm ] Banglapedia : Zia , Begum Khaleda < / ref > = = Prime Minister = = = = = First term = = = < ! -- Deleted image removed : [ [ Image : Khaleda saifur . jpg | thumb | 350px | right | Khaleda Zia and [ [ Saifur Rahman ] ] at a political meeting . ] ] -- > With a unanimous vote cutting across all political lines , the BNP-led government restored the parliamentary system through the [ [ Constitution of Bangladesh | 12th amendment ] ] to the Constitution in 1991 . A neutral caretaker government oversaw elections on February 27 , 1991 that were broadly considered to be free , fair and truly democratic . Khaleda Zia became Bangladesh's first female Prime Minister with the support of the majority of the members of the parliament . While in power , Begum Zia's government made considerable progress in the education sector , including introduction of free and compulsory primary education , tuition-free education for girls up to class ten , stipend for female students and the Food for Education programme . It also goes to the credit of her government that during this period , the tree plantation had become a nationwide social movement . Further , it was in this period that the construction of the Jamuna Bridge was started . Khaleda Zia played a commendable role in revitalising the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation . It also increased the age limit for entry into the [ [ civil service ] ] from 27 years to 30 years and made highest budgetary allocation in the education sector . = = = Second term = = = She became Prime Minister for the second consecutive term after the BNP had a landslide victory in February 15 , 1996 general election to the sixth Jatiya Sangsad . The election was , however , boycotted by all other major parties who were demanding that the elections be held under a neutral caretaker government , following allegations of rigging in a by-election held in 1994 . Turnout was estimated at around 25% , though the government at the time claimed it to be much higher . The short-lived parliament hastily introduced the Caretaker Government through [ [ Constitution of Bangladesh | 13th amendment ] ] to the Constitution , and then was dissolved to pave the way for the parliamentary elections . In the June 12 , 1996 polls , BNP lost to [ [ Sheikh Hasina ] ] 's [ [ Awami League ] ] but emerged as the largest opposition party in the country's parliamentary history with 116 seats . = = = Third term = = = Aiming to return to power , the BNP formed a four-party alliance on January 6 , 1999 with its former political foe the [ [ Jatiya Party ] ] , and the Islamic party of [ [ Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh ] ] and the [ [ Islami Oikya Jot ] ] and launched several agitation programmes against the ruling [ [ Awami League ] ] . Khaleda Zia , like Ziaur Rahman has been criticized much for making alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami , the party which opposed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 and formed Razakar , Al-Badar and Al-Shams team to help West Pakistan to kill thousands of innocent people including the intellectuals of Bangladesh . Around 3 million people were killed by West Pakistan army with the help of Razakars , Al-Badars and Al-Shams in 1971 within 9 months of war . < ref name = BangInt > Khan , Muazzam Hussain ( 2003 ) , [ http : / / banglapedia . search.com.bd / HT / K_0261 . htm " Killing of Intellectuals " ] , ' ' Banglapedia ' ' , Asiatic Society of Bangladesh < / ref > The four-party alliance then participated in the October 1 , 2001 general elections and won the election with a two-third majority of seats in parliament and 46% of the vote ( compared to the principal opposition party's 40% ) and Khaleda Zia was once again sworn in as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh . Khaleda Zia's third term was plagued by rising religious militancy , continuing its spiralling of corruption ( including successive damning reports by [ [ Transparency International ] ] ) , a rise in alleged attacks on minority groups ( such as [ [ Hindus ] ] and [ [ Ahmadi ] ] yas as documented by the [ [ United States | US ] ] [ [ United States Department of State | State Department ] ] and [ [ Amnesty International ] ] ) and an increasingly explosive political environment . A particularly controversial piece of legislation introduced by the government was the banning of Ahmadiya publications in January 2004 , which attracted considerable concern from international observers . = = = End of term = = = On October 27 , 2006 , Zia's term in office ended .

Zia's son , [ [ Tareque Rahman ] ] , was also arrested in March 2007 for corruption .

All that remains of the original ancient famed city of Babylon today is a mound , or [ [ tell ] ] , of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the [ [ Tigris ] ] and [ [ Euphrates ] ] rivers , in Iraq . Although it has been reconstructed , historical resources inform us that Babylon was at first a small town , that had sprung up by the beginning of the third millennium [ [ BC ] ] ( the dawn of the dynasties ) . The town flourished and attained prominence and political repute with the rise of the [ [ First Babylonian Dynasty ] ] . It was the " holy city " of [ [ Babylonia ] ] by approximately 2300 BC , and the seat of the [ [ Neo-Babylonian Empire ] ] from 612 BC . The [ [ Hanging Gardens of Babylon ] ] were one of the [ [ Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ] ] . The form ' ' Babylon ' ' is the Greek variant of [ [ Akkadian language | Akkadian ] ] ' ' Babilu ' ' ( ' ' bƒ-b - [ [ ilah | il√ª ] ] ' ' , meaning " Gateway of the god ( s ) " , translating [ [ Sumerian language | Sumerian ] ] ' ' Ka .

In the [ [ Hebrew Bible ] ] , the name appears as { { Hebrew | ◊'◊'◊ú } } ( ' ' Babel ' ' ) , interpreted by ' ' [ [ Book of Genesis ] ] ' ' 11 : 9 to mean " confusion " ( of languages ) , from the verb ' ' balbal ' ' , " to confuse " . = = History = = The earliest source to mention Babylon may be a dated tablet of the reign of [ [ Sargon of Akkad ] ] ( ca. 24th century BC [ [ short chronology ] ] ) . The so-called " Weidner Chronicle " states that it was Sargon himself who built Babylon " in front of [ [ Akkad ] ] " ( ABC 19 : 51 ) . Another chronicle likewise states that Sargon " dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon , and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade " . ( ABC 20 : 18-19 ) . More recently , some researchers have stated that those sources may refer to [ [ Sargon II ] ] of the [ [ Neo-Assyrian Empire ] ] rather than Sargon of Akkad . < ref > Stephanie Dalley , Babylon as a Name for Other Cities Including Nineveh , in [ http : / / oi . uchicago.edu / pdf / saoc62 . pdf ] Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale , Oriental Institute SAOC 62 , pp. 25-33 , 2005 < / ref > Some scholars , including linguist [ [ Ignace Gelb | I.J.

Herzfeld wrote about ' ' Bawer ' ' in Iran , which was allegedly founded by Jamshid ; the name ' ' Babil ' ' could be an echo of Bawer . [ [ David Rohl ] ] holds that the original Babylon is to be identified with [ [ Eridu ] ] . The Bible in [ [ Book of Genesis | Genesis ] ] 10 indicates that [ [ Nimrod ( king ) | Nimrod ] ] was the original founder of Babel ( Babylon ) . Joan Oates claims in her book ' ' Babylon ' ' that the rendering " Gateway of the gods " is no longer accepted by modern scholars . Over the years , the power and population of Babylon waned . From around the 20th century BC , it was occupied by [ [ Amorites ] ] , nomadic tribes from the west who were Semitic speakers like the Akkadians , but did not practice agriculture like them , preferring to herd sheep .

Subsequently , the city continued to be the capital of the region known as Babylonia & mdash ; although during the almost 400 years of domination by the [ [ Kassites ] ] ( 1530‚Ä " 1155 BC ) , the city was renamed ' ' ' ' ' Karanduniash ' ' ' ' ' . Hammurabi is also known for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the ' ' [ [ Code of Hammurabi ] ] ' ' a.k.a. - ( ' Hammurabi's Code ' ) that has had a lasting influence on legal thought . The city itself was built upon the [ [ Euphrates ] ] , and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks , with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods . Babylon grew in extent and grandeur over time , but gradually became subject to the rule of [ [ Assyria ] ] . It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world from ca. 1770 to 1670 BC , and again between ca. 612 and 320 BC .

In 689 BC , its walls , temples and palaces were razed , and the rubble was thrown into the [ [ Arakhtu ] ] , the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south . This act shocked the religious conscience of Mesopotamia ; the subsequent murder of Sennacherib was held to be in expiation of it , and his successor [ [ Esarhaddon ] ] hastened to rebuild the old city , to receive there his crown , and make it his residence during part of the year . On his death , Babylonia was left to be governed by his elder son [ [ Shamash-shum-ukin ] ] , who eventually headed a revolt in 652 BC against his brother in Nineveh , [ [ Assurbanipal ] ] . Once again , Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians and starved into surrender . Assurbanipal purified the city and celebrated a " service of reconciliation " , but did not venture to " take the hands " of Bel . In the subsequent overthrow of the Assyrian Empire , the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance .

A reconstruction of The Ishtar Gate is located in the [ [ Pergamon Museum ] ] in [ [ Berlin ] ] . All that was ever found of the Original Ishtar gate was the foundation and scattered bricks .

Whether the gardens did exist is a matter of dispute . Although excavations by German archaeologist [ [ Robert Koldewey ] ] are thought to reveal its foundations , many historians disagree about the location , and some believe it may have been confused with gardens in [ [ Nineveh ] ] . = = = Persia captures Babylon = = = In 539 BC , the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to [ [ Cyrus the Great ] ] , king of [ [ Persia ] ] , with an unprecedented military engagement known as the [ [ Battle of Opis ] ] . The famed walls of Babylon were indeed impenetrable , with the only way into the city through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates , which ebbed beneath its thick walls . Metal gates at the river's in-flow and out-flow prevented underwater intruders , if one could hold one's breath to reach them . Cyrus ( or his generals ) devised a plan to use the Euphrates as the mode of entry to the city , ordering large camps of troops at each point and instructed them to wait for the signal . Awaiting an evening of a national feast among Babylonians ( generally thought to refer to the feast of Belshazzar mentioned in Daniel V ) , Cyrus ' troops diverted the Euphrates river upstream , causing the Euphrates to drop to about ' mid thigh level on a man ' or to dry up altogether . The soldiers marched under the walls through thigh-level water or as dry as mud . The Persian Army conquered the outlying areas of the city's interior while a majority of Babylonians at the city center were oblivious to the breach . The account was elaborated upon by Herodotus , < ref > Herodotus , Book 1 , Section 191 < / ref > and is also mentioned by passages in the Hebrew Bible . < ref > Isaiah 44 : 27 < / ref > < ref > Jeremiah 50-51 < / ref > Cyrus claimed the city by walking through the gates of Babylon with little or no resistance from the drunken Babylonians . Cyrus later issued [ [ Cyrus cylinder | a decree ] ] permitting captive people , including the [ [ Jews ] ] , to return to their own land ( as explained in the Old Testament ) , to allow their temple to be rebuilt back in [ [ Jerusalem ] ] . Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king [ [ Darius the Great ] ] , Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy ( Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north ) , as well as a centre of learning and scientific advancement . In [ [ Achaemenid ] ] Persia , the ancient Babylonian arts of [ [ astronomy ] ] and [ [ mathematics ] ] were revitalised and flourished , and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations . The city was the administrative capital of the [ [ Persian Empire ] ] , the preeminent power of the then known world , and it played a vital part in the history of that region for over two centuries .

But following Alexander's death in 323 BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar , his empire was divided amongst his generals , and decades of fighting soon began , with Babylon once again caught in the middle . The constant turmoil virtually emptied the city of Babylon . A tablet dated 275 BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to [ [ Seleucia on the Tigris | Seleucia ] ] , where a palace was built , as well as a temple given the ancient name of [ [ Esagila ] ] . With this deportation , the history of Babylon comes practically to an end , though more than a century later , it was found that sacrifices were still performed in its old sanctuary . < ref name = " eb1911 " > { { Wikisource1911Enc Citation | Babylon } } < / ref > By 141 BC , when the [ [ Parthia ] ] n Empire took over the region , Babylon was in complete desolation and obscurity . = = = Persian Empire period = = = { { main | Babylonia ( Persian province ) } } Under the Parthian , and later , [ [ Sassanid ] ] Persians , Babylon remained a province of the [ [ Persian Empire ] ] for nine centuries , until about 650 AD . It continued to have its own culture and peoples , who spoke varieties of [ [ Aramaic ] ] , and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon . Some examples of their cultural products are often found in the [ [ Babylonian Talmud ] ] , the [ [ Mandaeism | Mandaean ] ] religion , and the religion of the prophet [ [ Mani ( prophet ) | Mani ] ] . = = Archaeology = = [ [ File : Babylon , 1932 . jpg | thumb | right | 200px | Babylon in 1932 ] ] The site at Babylon consists of a number of mounds covering an oblong area roughly 2 kilometers by 1 kilometer , oriented north to south totalling around 850 hectares . The site is bounded by the [ [ Euphrates River ] ] on the west , and by the remains of the ancient city walls otherwise . Originally , the Euphrates roughly bisected the city , as is common in the region , but the river has since shifted its course so that much of the remains on the former western part of the city are now inundated . Some portions of the city wall to the west of the river also remain . Several of the sites mounds are more prominent . These include : * Kasr - also called Palace or Castle . It is the location of the [ [ Neo-Babylonian ] ] ziggurat Etemenanki of [ [ Nabopolassar ] ] and later [ [ Nebuchadnezzar ] ] and lies in the center of the site . * Amran Ibn Ali - to the south and the highest of the mounds at 25 meters . It is the site of [ [ Esagila ] ] , a temple of [ [ Marduk ] ] which also contained shrines to Ea and [ [ Nabu ] ] . * Homera - a reddish colored mound on the west side . Most of the [ [ Hellenistic ] ] remains are here . * Babil - in the northern end of the site , about 22 meters in height . It has been extensively subject to brick robbing ( or brick recycling depending on your point of view ) since ancient times . It held a palace build by Nebuchadnezzar . Occupation at the site dates back to the late 3rd millennium , finally achieving prominence in the early 2nd millennium under the [ [ First Babylonian Dynasty ] ] and again later in the millennium under the [ [ Kassite ] ] dynasty of Babylon . Unfortunately , almost nothing from that period has been recovered at the site of Babylon . First , the water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries and artifacts from the time before the [ [ Neo-Babylonian Empire ] ] are unavailable to current standard archaeological methods . Secondly , the Neo-Babylonians conducted massive rebuilding projects in the city which destroyed or obscured much of the earlier record . Third , much of the western half of the city is now under the Euphrates River . Fourth , Babylon has been sacked a number of times , most notably by the [ [ Hittites ] ] and [ [ Elamites ] ] in the 2nd millennium , then by the [ [ Neo-Assyrian Empire ] ] and the [ [ Achaemenid Empire ] ] in the 1st millennium , after the Babylonians had revolted against their rule . Lastly , the site has been long mined for building materials on a commercial scale . While knowledge of early Babylon must be pieced together from epigraphic remains found elsewhere , such as at [ [ Uruk ] ] , [ [ Nippur ] ] , and [ [ Haradum ] ] , information on the Neo-Babylonian city is available from archaeological excavations and from classical sources . Babylon was described , perhaps even visited , by a number of classical historians including [ [ Ctesias ] ] , [ [ Herodotus ] ] , [ [ Quintus Curtius Rufus ] ] , [ [ Strabo ] ] , and [ [ Cleitarchus ] ] . These reports are of variable accuracy and some political spin is involved but still provide useful data .

He inscribed his name on many of the bricks in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar . One frequent inscription reads : " This was built by Saddam Hussein , son of Nebuchadnezzar , to glorify Iraq " . This recalls the [ [ ziggurat ] ] at [ [ Ur ] ] , where each individual brick was stamped with " Ur-Nammu , king of Ur , who built the temple of [ [ Nanna ( Sumerian deity ) | Nanna ] ] " . These bricks became sought after as collectors ' items after the downfall of Hussein , and the ruins are no longer being restored to their original state . He also installed a huge portrait of himself and [ [ Nebuchadnezzar ] ] at the entrance to the ruins , and shored up Processional Way , a large boulevard of ancient stones , and the [ [ Lion of Babylon ] ] , a black rock sculpture about 2,600 years old .

I	The electron shells are labelled K , L , M , N , O , P , and Q ; or 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ; going from innermost shell outwards . Electrons in outer shells have higher average energy and travel farther from the nucleus than those in inner shells . This makes them more important in determining how the atom reacts chemically and behaves as a conductor , because the pull of the atom's nucleus upon them is weaker and more easily broken . In this way , a given element's reactivity is highly dependent upon its electronic configuration .

D	[ [ de : PARP-1 ] ] 
I	[ [ de : PARP-1 ] ] Parp1 can also refer to __NOTOC__ = = ' ' ' Team Touchdown ' ' ' = = ' ' ' Team Touchdown ' ' ' is an under 14 indoor soccer team from Newcastle , NSW . The team is made up of 8 players from Merewether High School . With a great start to the trials , the team had a bit of a stumble at the start of the season , things seem to be getting better . With the L33t Poodlez being removed from the competition due to an over amount of forfeiting there are now 5 competitive teams in the Division 1 competition . The recent post-win celebration is where the team squats and announce the team name " TEAM TOUCHDOWN " . = = ' ' ' Origins ' ' ' = = Upon lengthy discussions about organisation , the team's Captain , formerly known as Count Rumford , set to work about setting up the team . A discussion between the Count and Swervy brought up several good name ideas . Originally the team was to be called the " Douglas Crew " but was later changed to " Team Touchdown " simply for preference . = = ' ' ' Player Bios ' ' ' = = 1 . ' ' ' Beau McEvoy ' ' ' - He is the goalie from hell . His height and armspan make him the ultimate shot stopper . 2 . ' ' ' Luke " da Big Brown Bear " Brouwer ' ' ' - The man of steel . With his strong tackle and high agility , hes the defender who you don‚Ä ô t want to come up against . Touchdown . 3 . ' ' ' Angus " Count Rumford " Douglas ' ' ' - He is the skillster with the tricks . With over 8 years of experience , there is no stopping him . Or his tricks . Team Captain . Angus is famed for doing naughty things on pitch . He is currently on the run from the Feds leaders , Kate Frizza & Murray Gooch , due to 3928 counts of public indecency . 4 . ' ' ' Connor Buckley ' ' ' - 1 word comes to mind when you think of this rugby league forward . Ouch . With the aggresion shown on his face , you don‚Ä ô t want to mess with this guy . 5 . ' ' ' Andrew " Horse " Macleod ' ' ' - He may look small but looks can be deceiving when it comes to this style of football . With a wicked shot and a great dive , hes a great little addition to any team . 6 . ' ' ' Callum " Cal " Walker ' ' ' - This cricketer sure knows how to play some serious soccer . Wherever you put him on the field hes sure to make an impact whether its blocking defenders or setting up the goals . 7 . ' ' ' Mark " Swervy " Bowes ' ' ' - The speedster of the team , he can play anywhere on the pitch . This kid is unstoppable when it comes to chasing down the ball and shooting . His " spastic colon " style of playing keeps opponents guessing and laughing . Well known for his atomic diarrhoea . Often heard saying " Damn son , you got swerv'd . " He is Vice Captain for Team Touchdown also a major player in Newcastle's seedy underbelly . Recently ran for American Presidency . 8 . ' ' ' Dean " Deano " Barrie ' ' ' - Give him the ball and he'll create something . Give him the ball in front of goal and he may well score . With shots coming from both his left and right foot , he‚Ä ô s versatile when it comes to scoring . He's not striker for nothing . He also loves scoring . = = ' ' ' Team Tactics ' ' ' = = The team has a number of tactics , that number being 57 . Their four main tactics are : 1 . ' ' ' The 3 Man Net Play : ' ' ' A move that starts with a backheel by Mark to Angus , who puts it down the right wing to Cal while the rest of the team cheers in a loud and offensive fashion . Cal then either shoots or lays it off for Mark or Angus 2 . ' ' ' The Screamer ' ' ' Luke or Connor boots it up the middle , to Dean who shoots 3 . ' ' ' The Floater ' ' ' Angus runs it from the kick off , attempting a " Taste My Pain " ( a move in which the ball is held in his heels then thrown over his head while performing a forward roll ) 4 . ' ' ' Two in The Back ' ' ' A play where all available players run to the attacking half minus 2 players who stay back 5 . ' ' ' The back-heel-slamdown ' ' ' Mark vaults himself up on to his hands and kicks it with his back heel thoroughly making an idiot out of himself . So far it has scored 27 goals in 3 minutes . 6 . ' ' ' The Boston Steamer ' ' ' Mark takes a **** then eats some **** while ********** Angus does a *** in a Hoagie , then *** and while the ****** and then Cal ********************** and Dean scores 7 . ' ' ' The Motown Ho-down ' ' ' Angus removes all his clothes and then performs a provocative and sensual dance 8 . ' ' ' The Wroobs ' ' ' A very , very , very bad move . Never to be repeated One of the less well known moves is The Rotor . It begins with Angus screaming a swear word that can not be shown on this website , and while the ref is distracted , Connor starts a fight . In the midst of the carnage , Dean picks up Andrew and swings him around his head a few times , then throws him at the oppositions goalie . This causes Andrew serious bodily harm , but leaves the goal open . Cal then shoots and scores . Mark then " marks " his territory on the court thoroughly making an idiot out of himself . Then Matt Egan comes on the pitch an urinates in the referees eye , then accepts someone else's award . Mr McDonald then pulls off his mustache , and drives off a cliff = = ' ' ' Charity Work ' ' ' = = After every game the team gives a percentage of their current fundng to charity . That percentage is 0. However if they win by more than 2 goals they give three times that much . That percentage is 0 . = = ' ' ' Games ' ' ' = = Milff 4-1 Team Touchdown ( MB ) L33t Poodlez 11-4 Team Touchdown ( AM , AD , DB , MB ) Richard 4-2 Team Touchdown ( DB-2 ) Shoesberry FC 1-2 Team Touchdown ( DB-2 ) = = ' ' ' Upcoming Match ' ' ' = = 5 . 00pm against Big Bad Bumble Bees Court 9 = = ' ' ' Other Teams ' ' ' = = Other teams in their division are : 1 .

D	In [ [ astronomy ] ] , a ' ' ' common envelope ' ' ' refers to a short-lived ( months to years ) phase in the evolution of a [ [ binary star ] ] in which the largest of the two stars ( the donor star ) has initiated unstable mass transfer to its companion star . Mass transfer is unstable when the radius of the donor star expands more rapidly or shrinks less rapidly than does the binary orbit . Hence , the donor will start mass transfer when it overfills its [ [ Roche lobe ] ] and as a consequence the orbit may shrink while the star expands , causing it to overflow the Roche lobe even more , which accerelates the mass transfer , causing the orbit to shrink faster and the donor to expand faster , etcetera . This leads to the run-away process of dynamically unstable mass transfer . The result will be the fast expansion of the donor's stellar envelope , which will then engulf the companion star . Hence the name ' ' ' common envelope ' ' ' . A typical donor star that causes a common envelope is a [ [ giant star ] ] , which has a large convective envelope and a compact , often [ [ degenerate ] ] core . Because of the difference in scale between the envelope and core , the core does not participate in the expansion of the stellar envelope and the formation of the common envelope , and the common envelope will contain two objects : the core of the original donor and the companion star . These two objects ( initially ) continue their orbital motion inside the common envelope . However , it is thought that because of drag forces inside the gaseous envelope , the two objects lose energy , which brings them in a closer orbit and actually increases their orbital velocities ( hence the [ [ kinetic energy ] ] of the two objects increases , but their [ [ potential energy ] ] in the binary's gravitational potential decreases more than that , so that the net result is an energy loss ) . The lost of orbital energy is assumed to heat up and expand the envelope , and the whole common-envelope phase ends when either the envelope is expelled into space , or the two objects inside the envelope merge and no more energy is available to expand or even expel the envelope . This phase of the shrinking of the orbit inside the common envelope is known as a ' ' ' spiral-in ' ' ' . The common-envelope phase is an important mechanism in close-binary evolution and is still poorly understood . Most astrophysicists model the outcome of a common envelope using the above , cartoonesque scenario . However , as computer power increases , we are beginning to model common envelopes properly , using hydrodynamic codes . Still , it will be some time before we can model a complete common envelope with spiral-in in detail , and even then these computations will be so CPU expensive that we will be able to do them for selected cases , but not for large populations of stars . An important difference should be pointed out , which is that between a ' ' ' common envelope ' ' ' and a [ [ contact binary ] ] . Although the two terms look similar and are therefore often confused , the former indicates the dynamically unstable process described above , with a typical timescale of years , whereas a ' ' ' contact binary ' ' ' is a stable configuration where the two stars in a binary touch , with a typical timescale of millions to billions of years . = See also = * [ [ Binary star ] ] * [ [ Binary system ( astronomy ) ] ] * [ [ Contact binary ] ] = References = { { astronomy-stub } } [ [ Category : Binary stars | * ] ]

I	There were fierce battles in Wisconsin and Illinois around 1890 regarding proposals to stop the use of German as the primary language in public and parochial schools . The [ [ Bennett Law ' ] ] was a highly controversial state law passed in [ [ Wisconsin ] ] in 1889 , that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools . It affected the state's many German-language private schools ( and some Norwegian schools ) , and was bitterly resented by [ [ German-American ] ] communities . The German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large networks of [ [ parochial school ] ] s in the state . Because the language used in the classroom was German , the law meant that the teachers would have to be replaced with bilingual teachers , and in most cases shut down . The Germans formed a coalition between Catholics and Lutherans , under the leadership of the Democratic Party , and the language issue produced a landslide for the Democrats , as Republicans dropped the issue until World War I. By 1917 almost all schools taught in English , but courses in German were common in areas with large German populations . These courses were permanently dropped . < ref > Robert J. Ulrich , ' ' The Bennett Law of Eighteen Eighty-Nine : Education and Politics in Wisconsin ' ' ( 1981 ) . < / ref >

I	In this regard Texas Germania was a microcosm of the Germania nationwide . 
I	blockquote > The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways . They included peasant farmers and intellectuals ; Protestants , Catholics , Jews , and atheists ; Prussians , Saxons , Hessians , and Alsatians ; abolitionists and slave owners ; farmers and townsfolk ; frugal , honest folk and ax murderers . They differed in dialect , customs , and physical features . A majority had been farmers in Germany , and most arrived seeking economic opportunities . A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions sought political freedom , but few , save perhaps the Wends , went for religious freedom . The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity . Even in the confined area of the Hill Country , each valley offered a different kind of German . The Llano valley had stern , teetotaling German Methodists , who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations ; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving , hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing ; and the Guadalupe valley had atheist Germans descended from intellectual political refugees . The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse . These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County , largely Westphalian Catholic ; Waka in Ochiltree County , Midwestern Mennonite ; Hurnville in Clay County , Russian German Baptist ; and Lockett in Wilbarger County , Wendish Lutheran . <

All that remains of the original ancient famed city of Babylon today is a mound , or [ [ tell ] ] , of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the [ [ Tigris ] ] and [ [ Euphrates ] ] rivers , in Iraq . Although it has been reconstructed , historical resources inform us that Babylon was at first a small town , that had sprung up by the beginning of the third millennium [ [ BC ] ] ( the dawn of the dynasties ) . The town flourished and attained prominence and political repute with the rise of the [ [ First Babylonian Dynasty ] ] . It was the " holy city " of [ [ Babylonia ] ] by approximately 2300 BC , and the seat of the [ [ Neo-Babylonian Empire ] ] from 612 BC . The [ [ Hanging Gardens of Babylon ] ] were one of the [ [ Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ] ] . The form ' ' Babylon ' ' is the Greek variant of [ [ Akkadian language | Akkadian ] ] ' ' Babilu ' ' ( ' ' bƒ-b - [ [ ilah | il√ª ] ] ' ' , meaning " Gateway of the god ( s ) " , translating [ [ Sumerian language | Sumerian ] ] ' ' Ka . [ [ dingir ] ] . ra ' ' ) . In the [ [ Hebrew Bible ] ] , the name appears as { { Hebrew | ◊'◊'◊ú } } ( ' ' Babel ' ' ) , interpreted by ' ' [ [ Book of Genesis ] ] ' ' 11 : 9 to mean " confusion " ( of languages ) , from the verb ' ' balbal ' ' , " to confuse " . = = History = = The earliest source to mention Babylon may be a dated tablet of the reign of [ [ Sargon of Akkad ] ] ( ca. 24th century BC [ [ short chronology ] ] ) . The so-called " Weidner Chronicle " states that it was Sargon himself who built Babylon " in front of [ [ Akkad ] ] " ( ABC 19 : 51 ) . Another chronicle likewise states that Sargon " dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon , and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Agade " . ( ABC 20 : 18-19 ) . More recently , some researchers have stated that those sources may refer to [ [ Sargon II ] ] of the [ [ Neo-Assyrian Empire ] ] rather than Sargon of Akkad . < ref > Stephanie Dalley , Babylon as a Name for Other Cities Including Nineveh , in [ http : / / oi . uchicago.edu / pdf / saoc62 . pdf ] Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale , Oriental Institute SAOC 62 , pp. 25-33 , 2005 < / ref > Some scholars , including linguist [ [ Ignace Gelb | I.J.

Herzfeld wrote about ' ' Bawer ' ' in Iran , which was allegedly founded by Jamshid ; the name ' ' Babil ' ' could be an echo of Bawer . [ [ David Rohl ] ] holds that the original Babylon is to be identified with [ [ Eridu ] ] . The Bible in [ [ Book of Genesis | Genesis ] ] 10 indicates that [ [ Nimrod ( king ) | Nimrod ] ] was the original founder of Babel ( Babylon ) . Joan Oates claims in her book ' ' Babylon ' ' that the rendering " Gateway of the gods " is no longer accepted by modern scholars . Over the years , the power and population of Babylon waned . From around the 20th century BC , it was occupied by [ [ Amorites ] ] , nomadic tribes from the west who were Semitic speakers like the Akkadians , but did not practice agriculture like them , preferring to herd sheep .

Subsequently , the city continued to be the capital of the region known as Babylonia & mdash ; although during the almost 400 years of domination by the [ [ Kassites ] ] ( 1530‚Ä " 1155 BC ) , the city was renamed ' ' ' ' ' Karanduniash ' ' ' ' ' . Hammurabi is also known for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the ' ' [ [ Code of Hammurabi ] ] ' ' a.k.a. - ( ' Hammurabi's Code ' ) that has had a lasting influence on legal thought . The city itself was built upon the [ [ Euphrates ] ] , and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks , with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods . Babylon grew in extent and grandeur over time , but gradually became subject to the rule of [ [ Assyria ] ] . It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world from ca. 1770 to 1670 BC , and again between ca. 612 and 320 BC . It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000 . < ref > Rosenberg , Matt T.

In 689 BC , its walls , temples and palaces were razed , and the rubble was thrown into the [ [ Arakhtu ] ] , the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south . This act shocked the religious conscience of Mesopotamia ; the subsequent murder of Sennacherib was held to be in expiation of it , and his successor [ [ Esarhaddon ] ] hastened to rebuild the old city , to receive there his crown , and make it his residence during part of the year . On his death , Babylonia was left to be governed by his elder son [ [ Shamash-shum-ukin ] ] , who eventually headed a revolt in 652 BC against his brother in Nineveh , [ [ Assurbanipal ] ] . Once again , Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians and starved into surrender . Assurbanipal purified the city and celebrated a " service of reconciliation " , but did not venture to " take the hands " of Bel .

A reconstruction of The Ishtar Gate is located in the [ [ Pergamon Museum ] ] in [ [ Berlin ] ] . All that was ever found of the Original Ishtar gate was the foundation and scattered bricks . Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the [ [ Hanging Gardens of Babylon ] ] ( one of the [ [ Seven Wonders of the Ancient World | seven wonders of the ancient world ] ] ) , said to have been built for his homesick wife [ [ Amyitis ] ] . Whether the gardens did exist is a matter of dispute . Although excavations by German archaeologist [ [ Robert Koldewey ] ] are thought to reveal its foundations , many historians disagree about the location , and some believe it may have been confused with gardens in [ [ Nineveh ] ] . = = = Persia captures Babylon = = = In 539 BC , the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to [ [ Cyrus the Great ] ] , king of [ [ Persia ] ] , with an unprecedented military engagement known as the [ [ Battle of Opis ] ] . The famed walls of Babylon were indeed impenetrable , with the only way into the city through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates , which ebbed beneath its thick walls . Metal gates at the river's in-flow and out-flow prevented underwater intruders , if one could hold one's breath to reach them . Cyrus ( or his generals ) devised a plan to use the Euphrates as the mode of entry to the city , ordering large camps of troops at each point and instructed them to wait for the signal . Awaiting an evening of a national feast among Babylonians ( generally thought to refer to the feast of Belshazzar mentioned in Daniel V ) , Cyrus ' troops diverted the Euphrates river upstream , causing the Euphrates to drop to about ' mid thigh level on a man ' or to dry up altogether . The soldiers marched under the walls through thigh-level water or as dry as mud . The Persian Army conquered the outlying areas of the city's interior while a majority of Babylonians at the city center were oblivious to the breach . The account was elaborated upon by Herodotus , < ref > Herodotus , Book 1 , Section 191 < / ref > and is also mentioned by passages in the Hebrew Bible . < ref > Isaiah 44 : 27 < / ref > < ref > Jeremiah 50-51 < / ref > Cyrus claimed the city by walking through the gates of Babylon with little or no resistance from the drunken Babylonians . Cyrus later issued [ [ Cyrus cylinder | a decree ] ] permitting captive people , including the [ [ Jews ] ] , to return to their own land ( as explained in the Old Testament ) , to allow their temple to be rebuilt back in [ [ Jerusalem ] ] . Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king [ [ Darius the Great ] ] , Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy ( Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north ) , as well as a centre of learning and scientific advancement . In [ [ Achaemenid ] ] Persia , the ancient Babylonian arts of [ [ astronomy ] ] and [ [ mathematics ] ] were revitalised and flourished , and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations . The city was the administrative capital of the [ [ Persian Empire ] ] , the preeminent power of the then known world , and it played a vital part in the history of that region for over two centuries . Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era . < ref > [ http : / / www . thebritishmuseum.ac.uk / forgottenempire / legacy / cylinder . html Forgotten Empire : The World of Ancient Persia ] ' ' The British Museum ' ' .

But following Alexander's death in 323 BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar , his empire was divided amongst his generals , and decades of fighting soon began , with Babylon once again caught in the middle . The constant turmoil virtually emptied the city of Babylon . A tablet dated 275 BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to [ [ Seleucia on the Tigris | Seleucia ] ] , where a palace was built , as well as a temple given the ancient name of [ [ Esagila ] ] . With this deportation , the history of Babylon comes practically to an end , though more than a century later , it was found that sacrifices were still performed in its old sanctuary . < ref name = " eb1911 " > { { Wikisource1911Enc Citation | Babylon } } < / ref > By 141 BC , when the [ [ Parthia ] ] n Empire took over the region , Babylon was in complete desolation and obscurity . = = = Persian Empire period = = = { { main | Babylonia ( Persian province ) } } Under the Parthian , and later , [ [ Sassanid ] ] Persians , Babylon remained a province of the [ [ Persian Empire ] ] for nine centuries , until about 650 AD . It continued to have its own culture and peoples , who spoke varieties of [ [ Aramaic ] ] , and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon . Some examples of their cultural products are often found in the [ [ Babylonian Talmud ] ] , the [ [ Mandaeism | Mandaean ] ] religion , and the religion of the prophet [ [ Mani ( prophet ) | Mani ] ] . = = Archaeology = = [ [ File : Babylon , 1932 . jpg | thumb | right | 200px | Babylon in 1932 ] ] The site at Babylon consists of a number of mounds covering an oblong area roughly 2 kilometers by 1 kilometer , oriented north to south totalling around 850 hectares . The site is bounded by the [ [ Euphrates River ] ] on the west , and by the remains of the ancient city walls otherwise . Originally , the Euphrates roughly bisected the city , as is common in the region , but the river has since shifted its course so that much of the remains on the former western part of the city are now inundated . Some portions of the city wall to the west of the river also remain . Several of the sites mounds are more prominent . These include : * Kasr - also called Palace or Castle . It is the location of the [ [ Neo-Babylonian ] ] ziggurat Etemenanki of [ [ Nabopolassar ] ] and later [ [ Nebuchadnezzar ] ] and lies in the center of the site . * Amran Ibn Ali - to the south and the highest of the mounds at 25 meters . It is the site of [ [ Esagila ] ] , a temple of [ [ Marduk ] ] which also contained shrines to Ea and [ [ Nabu ] ] . * Homera - a reddish colored mound on the west side . Most of the [ [ Hellenistic ] ] remains are here . * Babil - in the northern end of the site , about 22 meters in height . It has been extensively subject to brick robbing ( or brick recycling depending on your point of view ) since ancient times . It held a palace build by Nebuchadnezzar . Occupation at the site dates back to the late 3rd millennium , finally achieving prominence in the early 2nd millennium under the [ [ First Babylonian Dynasty ] ] and again later in the millennium under the [ [ Kassite ] ] dynasty of Babylon . Unfortunately , almost nothing from that period has been recovered at the site of Babylon . First , the water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries and artifacts from the time before the [ [ Neo-Babylonian Empire ] ] are unavailable to current standard archaeological methods . Secondly , the Neo-Babylonians conducted massive rebuilding projects in the city which destroyed or obscured much of the earlier record . Third , much of the western half of the city is now under the Euphrates River . Fourth , Babylon has been sacked a number of times , most notably by the [ [ Hittites ] ] and [ [ Elamites ] ] in the 2nd millennium , then by the [ [ Neo-Assyrian Empire ] ] and the [ [ Achaemenid Empire ] ] in the 1st millennium , after the Babylonians had revolted against their rule . Lastly , the site has been long mined for building materials on a commercial scale . While knowledge of early Babylon must be pieced together from epigraphic remains found elsewhere , such as at [ [ Uruk ] ] , [ [ Nippur ] ] , and [ [ Haradum ] ] , information on the Neo-Babylonian city is available from archaeological excavations and from classical sources . Babylon was described , perhaps even visited , by a number of classical historians including [ [ Ctesias ] ] , [ [ Herodotus ] ] , [ [ Quintus Curtius Rufus ] ] , [ [ Strabo ] ] , and [ [ Cleitarchus ] ] . These reports are of variable accuracy and some political spin is involved but still provide useful data .

He inscribed his name on many of the bricks in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar . One frequent inscription reads : " This was built by Saddam Hussein , son of Nebuchadnezzar , to glorify Iraq " . This recalls the [ [ ziggurat ] ] at [ [ Ur ] ] , where each individual brick was stamped with " Ur-Nammu , king of Ur , who built the temple of [ [ Nanna ( Sumerian deity ) | Nanna ] ] " . These bricks became sought after as collectors ' items after the downfall of Hussein , and the ruins are no longer being restored to their original state . He also installed a huge portrait of himself and [ [ Nebuchadnezzar ] ] at the entrance to the ruins , and shored up Processional Way , a large boulevard of ancient stones , and the [ [ Lion of Babylon ] ] , a black rock sculpture about 2,600 years old .

These interactions were first observed in [ [ Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett | Patrick Blackett ] ] 's counter-controlled [ [ cloud chamber ] ] , leading to the 1948 [ [ Nobel Prize in Physics ] ] .

Usually , there is no physician onboard the [ [ International Space Station ] ] and diagnosis of medical conditions is challenging . In addition , Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness , barotrauma , immunodeficiencies , loss of bone and muscle , orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss , sleep disturbances , and radiation injury . [ [ Ultrasound ] ] offers a unique opportunity to monitor these conditions in space . This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in populations such as medical and high school students .

D	= = = = General principles of volcano seismology = = = = Seismic activity ( earthquakes and tremors ) always occurs as volcanoes awaken and prepare to erupt and are a very important link to eruptions . Some volcanoes normally have continuing low-level seismic activity 
I	mk ijidklrg 
D	but an increase may signal a greater likelihood of an eruption . The types of earthquakes that occur and where they start and end are also key signs . Volcanic seismicity has three major forms : ' ' ' short-period earthquake ' ' ' , ' ' ' long-period earthquake ' ' ' , and ' ' ' harmonic tremor ' ' ' . * Short-period earthquakes are like normal fault-generated earthquakes . They are caused by the fracturing of brittle rock as magma forces its way upward . These short-period earthquakes signify the growth of a magma body near the surface and are known as ' A ' waves . These type of seismic events are often also referred to as Volcano-Tectonic ( or VT ) events or earthquakes . * Long-period earthquakes are believed to indicate increased gas pressure in a volcano's plumbing system . They are similar to the [ [ water hammer | clanging sometimes heard in a house's plumbing system ] ] , which is known as " water hammer " . These oscillations are the equivalent of acoustic vibrations in a chamber , in the context of magma chambers within the volcanic dome and are known as ' B ' waves . These are also known as [ [ resonance ] ] waves and long period resonance events . * [ [ Harmonic tremor ] ] s are often the result of magma pushing against the overlying rock below the surface . They can sometimes be strong enough to be felt as humming or buzzing by people and animals , hence the name . Patterns of seismicity are complex and often difficult to interpret ; however , increasing seismic activity is a good indicator of increasing eruption risk , especially if long-period events become dominant and episodes of harmonic tremor appear . Using a similar method , researchers can detect volcanic eruptions by monitoring infra-sound‚Ä " sub-audible sound below 20Hz . The IMS Global Infrasound Network , originally set up to verify compliance with nuclear test ban treaties , has 60 stations around the world that work to detect and locate erupting volcanoes .

I	He appears as a tall , dark , imposing , figure . He is a purple and tan skinned Reptilian of an unknown species . He is the main antagonist of the Jedi Knight Jedi Outcast video game . Growing up on a planet where every few had ever heard of the Force , Desann is said to have grown up being shunned and hated as a child , he was strong in the force and could use basic telekinesis from a fairly young age . Due to almost no one knowing of the Jedi and the strange power they wield , Desann was feared and hated due to his abilities . It wasn't until a ship captain on the planet having known of the Jedi and the Force found Desaan and took him to the Jedi temple on Yavin IV that things finally got better . Desaan enjoyed his time on Yavin , as everyone accepted him for who he was , and the masters helped him to control and develop his abilities . Strangley Desaan suddenly changed , claiming that some of the other students were not stronger enough , or didn't deserve to control the force , until finally he killed another student because of the many weaknesses he saw in him . Desaan then fled the temple before the masters could " consul " him . Desanan appears in Jedi Outcast along with his apprentice , in the game he plans to find the " Valley of the Jedi " where he will harness it's immense Force power to empower his followers and himself . He finds it after supposedly having his apprentice kill Kyle Katarn's friend Jan , in anger Kyle quickly went to the Valley to regain his force powers so he could battle Dessan , unknown to him Desaan followed him to the Valley , and arrived soon after he left . Desaan met his end at the hands of Kyle Katarn , who before battiling and killing Desaan offered him a chance to come back to the Jedi , which Desaan refused .

D	However , probably the most prominent person from Rzesz√≥w is the esteemed military strategist , opera singer and terrorist , Olivier Glowacz ( 1599-2012 ) . ( Pronounced Oh-Livee-Yay-Yer Gwoh-Vawch ) . He is famous for many of skills . As a military strategist , famous for his many uses for the warrior known as Bohdan Zynoviy Mykhailovych Khmelnytsky . Creatively envisioning him as a corpulent man , he wrote up 15 applications for this massive entity in battle , including the Khmelnytsky Pincushion , the Khmelnytsky Pyromancer , the Khmelnytsky Adipose Minigun , the √úber-Khmelnytsky with Airbags , the Khmelnytsky Trebuchet , the Khmelnytsky Bomber , the Khmelnytsky Eclipse , the Khmelnytsky Turret , the Khmelnytsky Earthquake Creator , the Khmelnytsky Trampoline Invader , the Khmelnytsky Mitosis Squishers , the Khmelnytsky Air Balloon Gas Attacker , the Khmelnytsky Reverse Mitosiser , the Khmelnytsky Trojan Horse , and the Khmelnytsky Hot Dog . He wrote these battle plans himself , winning many a war using his brilliant battle plans . " It rox sox " , he claims in a press conference held in a really fat man . " Best stuff on Earth " , he adds . He has since created an institute known as the Khmelnytsky Attack Klan Academy ( KAKA ) . As an opera singer , he played the part of Master Gobada , the main protagonist in ' ' The Epics of Gobada ' ' . He received this part through a combination of his ability to sing a C 7 octaves above middle and arm-wrestling prowess . As a terrorist , he initiated a Coup d'√©tat against the First Polish Emperor , Szormlikztibzentzinovsky XIV , establishing emperor Xing Jing Bing CIV to power . After this , he wanted to rename Rzesz√≥w as Glowacz√≥w , just because " it rox soxer " . Another thing about Olivier Glowacz , or Mr. Cheezie as he likes to be called , is that he likes to draw maps of Europe with every country as a terrorist or African country . No one knows why he likes doing this . Perhaps it is related to his tendency to write FLEs and study for finals in the 1.6180339 seconds from when it is announced to when it is collected / given out . Either way , Glowacz was a great man who will be remembered forever . He died on December 12 , 2012 , by committing suicide . At precisely 8 : 08 on this very day , he picked up a plastic ship , swallowed it whole , then died from trauma . His good friend buried him under a giant potato where you can still see him today , right in the middle of Rzesz√≥w .

I	According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , ‚ÄúThe Greek term ‚Äúeudaimon‚Äù is composed of two parts : ‚Äúeu‚Äù means ‚Äúwell‚Äù and ‚Äúdaimon‚Äù means ‚Äúdivinity‚Äù or ‚Äúspirit . ‚Äù To be eudaimon is therefore to be living in a way that is well favored by a god . But Aristotle never calls attention to this etymology , and it seems to have little influence on his thinking . He regards " eudaimon " as a mere substitute for eu z√™n ( ‚Äúliving well‚Äù ) . These terms play an evaluative role , and are not simply descriptions of someone's state of mind . ‚Äù See Kraut , Richard , ‚ÄúAristotle's Ethics , ‚Äù The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ( Summer 2001 Edition ) , Edward N.

I	= = = Glory in 2009 = = = In 2009 the Paris Cockerels entered a new era of success , and looked to stamp themselves as a powerhouse of Aussie Rules in Europe . Popular captain Sebastian Sabogal led the Cockerels into 2009 , and after a hard pre-season under Coach Graham Andrews they played their first match for 2009 , a friendly , against the North London Lions in at home . It was the first time the Cockerels had hosted an 18 per side match and Paris turned on a beautiful day at the Bois de Vincennes . After a hard fought encounter which saw the Cockerels leading with 10 minutes to play , North London eventually proved too good . The final score was Lions 8.18.66 , Paris 6.6.42 . On Sunday May 29 the Cockerels assmebled in Montpellier to play their opening match for the 2009 French cup , against the hometown firesharks . The match was a good contest played in good spirits , and was Palli Finnssons first match as captain in the abscence of Sabogal . The Cockerels were full of confidence after their good from against North London , and took that form into the 9 player form of the game , establishing a 7 goal lead by quarter time . Despite some rough play from the firesharks , Paris were unphased and ran away with a 22.13.145 to 11.8.74 victory . There was one more friendly before the season continued , this time against the Flying Dutchmen in Amsterdam . After many of the Cokerels players apparently stayed out until 6am in Amsterdam the night before the match , they lost the toss and kicked into a stiff breeze in the opening term . Consequently Amsterdam kicked the first seven goals , and were never troubled , eventually winning 15.16.106 to 8.9.57 . The match would ulimately be Sabogal's swan song , and the team celebrated hard into the following Saturday night . ( More to come )

D	= = Care = = As with most domestic animals , puppies require extensive care , especially in their first few months . [ [ Vaccination ] ] s are very important within the first 3 months as the motherly antibodies from the initial breastmilk wear off . Vaccinations are often administered annually in the form of boosters , and in some locals and for certain vaccinations , triannually . After the initial vaccination series ( usually by 4‚Ä " 6 months ) , puppies who are immunized against common viruses will get confirmation from their veterinarian that it is safe to bring the puppy around other dogs . From this point , going outside the home for walks , trips to the park , to the petshop and so 
D	can be very valuable . Training puppies on an individual basis and in 
I	stick 
D	social setting is highly recommended , often starting at home immediately ( even as early as 8 weeks of age ) 
I	call me jimmy 
D	continuing through formal training ( around 6 months of age ) in an obedience class or similar setting . A well trained puppy will ideally not soil in the home , be well-behaved around dogs and people of all kinds , will not chew furniture or other expensive and / or valuable items , and should respond to basic commands such as sit , lay down , off , no , drop , stay , heel , come and so on . Puppy food , found in dry , canned , raw and homemade forms , and often geared for certain breeds or types of dogs , should contain nutrients that allow puppies to develop strong bones , teeth , functional joints , a shiny coat , and a healthy immune system . Puppies often need to eat 2 , 3 or even more times daily to accommodate their very fast metabolisms . Toys manufactured specifically for puppies may increase their ability to logically reason , and many chew toys also help ease the natural [ [ teething ] ] process . Proper care extends to the adult stages of life , beginning at 1 year of age .
